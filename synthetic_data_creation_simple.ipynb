              " 'text': \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - European stocks closed lower on Tuesday, the first trading day of 2018, while Wall Street advanced and the U.S. dollar fell to its weakest in over three months against key currencies.\\nA trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., January 2, 2018. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD PUS gained 0.61 percent. The index had set scores of record highs and rose by one-fifth in value in 2017.\\nMajor stock indexes closed 2017 with their best performance since 2013. In the U.S. market, the advance came amid strong economic growth and corporate earnings, low interest rates and hopes, now realized, of U.S. corporate tax cuts.\\nU.S. equity indexes advanced on Tuesday, buoyed by gains in technology and consumer discretionary stocks.\\nIncreases in Apple ( AAPL.O ), Facebook ( FB.O ), Alphabet ( GOOGL.O ) and Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) shares pulled the S&P 500 index higher on Tuesday.\\n“People are back to looking at what have been the winners. It has been very momentum driven,” said Rick Meckler, president of hedge fund LibertyView Capital Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey.\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 59.79 points, or 0.24 percent, to 24,779.01, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 17.15 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,690.76 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 91.91 points, or 1.33 percent, to 6,995.30.\\nIn Europe, equities closed lower after autos stocks fell following weaker car registrations data. Trading was also cautious ahead of the launch of a major reform of European financial markets.\\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.21 percent along with euro zone stocks .STOXXE, down 0.19 percent.\\nShares rose in Asia. Shanghai blue chips .CSI300 climbed 1.41 percent and MSCI's 24-country emerging market stock index .MSCIEF jumped to a multi-year high after the Caixin index of Chinese industry rose to a four-month high of 51.5 in December, confounding forecasts for a decline.\\nFALLING DOLLAR The dollar index .DXY, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.23 percent. It was hampered by market expectations of a slower pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve amid a tepid U.S. inflation picture.\\nThe dollar had already hit a three-month low .DXY on Friday, bringing its losses for 2017 to 9.8 percent, its worst performance since 2003.\\nOther currencies gained. The euro EUR= rose 0.3 percent to $1.2044 and hit a four-month high on Tuesday after data showed that euro zone manufacturers ramped up activity last month at the fastest pace in more than two decades.\\nThe Japanese yen strengthened 0.28 percent at 112.35 per dollar, while sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3594, up 0.69 percent on the day.\\nU.S. Treasury yields rose in line with European government yields. A European Central Bank official said the bank’s massive bond purchase program might not continue later this year.\\nA reversal of year-end buying has also driven U.S. Treasury yields higher, said Brian Rehling, co-head of global fixed income strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.\\n“Lots of institutions buy Treasuries to hold over year-end for liquidity. To see that reversal early in the year is not a surprise,” Rehling said.\\nBenchmark U.S. 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 16/32 in price to yield 2.4687 percent, from 2.411 percent late on Friday.\\nThe 30-year bond US30YT=RR last fell 45/32 in price to yield 2.8105 percent, from 2.741 percent late on Friday.\\nU.S. crude CLcv1 fell 0.13 percent to $60.34 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was at $66.52, down 0.52 percent. Oil prices earlier had enjoyed their strongest start to a year since 2014 amid large anti-government rallies in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia.\\nCopper CMCU3 lost 0.42 percent to $7,216.50 a tonne, but that follows a rise of 31 percent in 2017 to a four-year top.\\nSpot gold XAU= added 1.0 percent to $1,315.15 an ounce, after advancing by 13 percent in 2017 for its best performance in seven years.\\nAdditional reporting by Marc Jones, Dmitry Zhdannikov and Helen Reid in London, Henning Gloystein in Singapore, Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru, and Richard Leong and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Nick Zieminski\\n \",\n",

              "\"Global Markets: Asia shares reach decade top on China data, dollar in doldrums\\n\\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - European stocks closed lower on Tuesday, the first trading day of 2018, while Wall Street advanced and the U.S. dollar fell to its weakest in over three months against key currencies.\\nA trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., January 2, 2018. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD PUS gained 0.61 percent. The index had set scores of record highs and rose by one-fifth in value in 2017.\\nMajor stock indexes closed 2017 with their best performance since 2013. In the U.S. market, the advance came amid strong economic growth and corporate earnings, low interest rates and hopes, now realized, of U.S. corporate tax cuts.\\nU.S. equity indexes advanced on Tuesday, buoyed by gains in technology and consumer discretionary stocks.\\nIncreases in Apple ( AAPL.O ), Facebook ( FB.O ), Alphabet ( GOOGL.O ) and Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) shares pulled the S&P 500 index higher on Tuesday.\\n“People are back to looking at what have been the winners. It has been very momentum driven,” said Rick Meckler, president of hedge fund LibertyView Capital Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey.\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 59.79 points, or 0.24 percent, to 24,779.01, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 17.15 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,690.76 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 91.91 points, or 1.33 percent, to 6,995.30.\\nIn Europe, equities closed lower after autos stocks fell following weaker car registrations data. Trading was also cautious ahead of the launch of a major reform of European financial markets.\\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.21 percent along with euro zone stocks .STOXXE, down 0.19 percent.\\nShares rose in Asia. Shanghai blue chips .CSI300 climbed 1.41 percent and MSCI's 24-country emerging market stock index .MSCIEF jumped to a multi-year high after the Caixin index of Chinese industry rose to a four-month high of 51.5 in December, confounding forecasts for a decline.\\nFALLING DOLLAR The dollar index .DXY, tracking the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.23 percent. It was hampered by market expectations of a slower pace of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve amid a tepid U.S. inflation picture.\\nThe dollar had already hit a three-month low .DXY on Friday, bringing its losses for 2017 to 9.8 percent, its worst performance since 2003.\\nOther currencies gained. The euro EUR= rose 0.3 percent to $1.2044 and hit a four-month high on Tuesday after data showed that euro zone manufacturers ramped up activity last month at the fastest pace in more than two decades.\\nThe Japanese yen strengthened 0.28 percent at 112.35 per dollar, while sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3594, up 0.69 percent on the day.\\nU.S. Treasury yields rose in line with European government yields. A European Central Bank official said the bank’s massive bond purchase program might not continue later this year.\\nA reversal of year-end buying has also driven U.S. Treasury yields higher, said Brian Rehling, co-head of global fixed income strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.\\n“Lots of institutions buy Treasuries to hold over year-end for liquidity. To see that reversal early in the year is not a surprise,” Rehling said.\\nBenchmark U.S. 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 16/32 in price to yield 2.4687 percent, from 2.411 percent late on Friday.\\nThe 30-year bond US30YT=RR last fell 45/32 in price to yield 2.8105 percent, from 2.741 percent late on Friday.\\nU.S. crude CLcv1 fell 0.13 percent to $60.34 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was at $66.52, down 0.52 percent. Oil prices earlier had enjoyed their strongest start to a year since 2014 amid large anti-government rallies in Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia.\\nCopper CMCU3 lost 0.42 percent to $7,216.50 a tonne, but that follows a rise of 31 percent in 2017 to a four-year top.\\nSpot gold XAU= added 1.0 percent to $1,315.15 an ounce, after advancing by 13 percent in 2017 for its best performance in seven years.\\nAdditional reporting by Marc Jones, Dmitry Zhdannikov and Helen Reid in London, Henning Gloystein in Singapore, Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru, and Richard Leong and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Nick Zieminski\\n \""

Garrett Pagon, President and co-founder, will step into the role of CEO. Balkissoon will focus on further building the technology and organization of OGSystems’ recent tech start-up spinout, GeoSpark Analytics, serving as the new company’s CEO ( http://bizj.us/1pgb99 ). OGSystems also announced the recent promotion of Steve Martin as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Dan Ehrmantraut to Chief Financial Officer (CFO).\\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180109005313/en/\\nOGSystems announces new executive leadership team. (Pictured left to right: Dan Ehrmantraut, Garrett Pagon, and Steve Martin) (Photo: Business Wire)\\n“Since OGSystems’ founding, Garrett and I have put our heart and soul into the mission of making a positive impact on national security and the goal of providing growth opportunities for our people,” Balkissoon said. “We have a relentless focus on finding the right people, playing to their strengths, and empowering them to Own the Outcome. As co-founders, we’ve watched the company grow in ways we couldn’t imagine by enabling others to step into new roles with an eye towards delivering the best execution in the business. Having Garrett by my side has been instrumental to the journey as CEO, and that formula doesn’t change as I transition to Chairman with me by his.”\\nPagon is a graduate of Stanford University and served as an intelligence officer for the United States Air Force before he and Balkissoon founded OGSystems in 2005. Through his leadership, the company has become a recognized and trusted prime contractor capable of winning and executing large engineering projects for the IC. He is responsible for scaling an entrepreneurial outfit into a large and reliable organization, while keeping the innovative spirit of the original culture.\\n“People are the secret sauce at OGSystems,” said Pagon. “We give leaders from within an opportunity to grow and we recognize those responsible for our success. Both Steve and Dan have the right combination of skill, commitment to leading their teams, and tremendous respect from their peers and industry partners.”\\nWith more than 20 years of DoD and IC experience - including over 10 years with OGSystems - Steve Martin has helped build the culture, client relationships, partnerships, and approaches that are the foundation of the company’s success. Previously serving as the Executive Partner responsible for performance on all client programs, Martin led the doubling of OGSystems revenues in the last three years. Known for a commitment to personnel development and increasing mission performance through innovation, he has overseen increases in key metrics such as employee retention to over twice the industry average.\\nDan Ehrmantraut joined OGSystems in 2014 and quickly established the growing organization’s first in-house corporate finance and accounting department. In three years, he has proven himself as an outstanding leader in command of all financial aspects of the business and now formally assumes the role from Bill Earle as the interim CFO. As CFO, Ehrmantraut manages an agile, high-performing team responsible for contract/subcontract management, corporate accounting, payroll, program control, cost proposals, and corporate financial reporting and forecasting.\\nAbout OGSystems\\nOGSystems’ (OGS) mission is to provide technically advanced geospatial and security solutions to customers through constant innovation, effecting positive change in every engagement. In an industry accustomed to long and inefficient system development cycles, OGS thinks differently - we are an alternative for DoD and IC clients seeking nimble companies to solve their most difficult problems. Headquartered in Chantilly, Virginia, with regional offices in St. Louis, Missouri, San Diego, California, and Portland, Oregon, OGS employs over 300 geospatial engineers, software developers, data scientists and mission subject matter experts.

Police officers patrol outside a court where retired superintendent Frankly Chu was given a jail term in Hong Kong, China January 3, 2018. REUTERS/Bobby Yip \\nChu, however, said during the trial that his use of force had been appropriate and that he was carrying out orders from his superiors to move protesters away from that area. \\nChu\\u2019s lawyer, Peter Pannu, said his client would appeal. Slideshow (3 Images) \\nA Hong Kong court last February also sentenced seven policemen to two years behind bars for beating a handcuffed activist during the 2014 protests. The seven have been released on bail pending appeal. \\nThe assaults by the seven policemen, and Chu, were captured on video and widely broadcast, triggering public outrage and tarnishing the reputation of the Hong Kong police force that has sometimes been dubbed \\u201cAsia\\u2019s finest\\u201d. \\nPolice support groups, however, say the officers were only maintaining public order. After the sentencing, around 30 supporters of Chu yelled: \\u201cHong Kong\\u2019s judiciary is unfair. Hong Kong police were insulted\\u201d. \\nA University of Hong Kong poll that surveyed over a thousand people shows public satisfaction with the police force\\u2019s performance after the Occupy protests were cleared in December 2014 plummeted to the lowest point since the handover right. \\nThe half yearly figure has since risen from 21 percent in the first six months of 2015 to 37 percent in the last six months.

Police officers patrol outside a court where retired superintendent Frankly Chu was given a jail term in Hong Kong, China January 3, 2018. REUTERS/Bobby Yip \\nChu, however, said during the trial that his use of force had been appropriate and that he was carrying out orders from his superiors to move protesters away from that area. \\nChu\\u2019s lawyer, Peter Pannu, said his client would appeal. Slideshow (3 Images) \\nA Hong Kong court last February also sentenced seven policemen to two years behind bars for beating a handcuffed activist during the 2014 protests. The seven have been released on bail pending appeal. \\nThe assaults by the seven policemen, and Chu, were captured on video and widely broadcast, triggering public outrage and tarnishing the reputation of the Hong Kong police force that has sometimes been dubbed \\u201cAsia\\u2019s finest\\u201d. \\nPolice support groups, however, say the officers were only maintaining public order. After the sentencing, around 30 supporters of Chu yelled: \\u201cHong Kong\\u2019s judiciary is unfair. Hong Kong police were insulted\\u201d. \\nA University of Hong Kong poll that surveyed over a thousand people shows public satisfaction with the police force\\u2019s performance after the Occupy protests were cleared in December 2014 plummeted to the lowest point since the handover right. \\nThe half yearly figure has since risen from 21 percent in the first six months of 2015 to 37 percent in the last six months.

(TSX:ORV) (the \\\"Company\\\" or \\\"Orvana\\\") announced today financial and operational results for the first quarter (\\\"Q1 2018\\\"). The Company is also providing financial and operational updates for its El Valle and Carl\\u00e9s Mines (collectively, \\\"El Valle\\\") operations in northern Spain and its Don Mario Mine in Bolivia.\\nThe unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for Q1 2018 and Management's Discussion and Analysis related thereto are available on SEDAR and on the Company's website at www.orvana.com .\\nQ1 2018 Highlights\\nThe Company's strategy to increase production at its El Valle operation targets productivity enhancements to allow for delivery of higher gold ore grades to the mill that are expected to result in higher gold ounces to be produced and reduced unitary costs, while at Don Mario the Company is focusing on nearby gold deposits to extend its mine life. The Company reports the following positive developments in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as follows:\\nEl Valle \\u2013 Ramp up of oxides production continues: The proportion of higher gold grade oxide production delivered to the mill from the El Valle Mine increased to 37%, up from 24% in the second half of fiscal 2017. The Company continues to target a ratio of 50% oxides to skarns delivered to the mill by mid-2018.\\nProduction shortfalls were experienced in the first quarter due to fleet availability and the failure in the mine's ventilation system, as well as an unexpected build-up of in-process gold in the plant circuit. A number of process changes in the mine and plant, in addition to maintenance investments, are expected to allow El Valle to attain its stated production guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year. Don Mario \\u2013 Consistent performance: Don Mario continued to generate consistent results from its carbon-in-leach circuit, producing 12,388 ounces of gold with recovery rates averaging 85.8% in the quarter.\\nPre-stripping activities at the Company's nearby Cerro Felix gold deposit commenced during the first quarter. The Company is aiming to begin production from the Cerro Felix deposit starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\\nJuan Gavidia, Interim CEO stated, \\\"Our Don Mario operation continues to deliver consistently strong results from LMZ ore processed through its carbon-in-leach circuit, and we look forward to maintaining this trend with ore from our nearby Cerro Felix gold deposit shortly. At El Valle, our ramp up of higher gold grade oxide production continues, though on a longer timeframe than initially planned. The challenges that we experienced at El Valle in Q1 are in the process of being resolved. Our updated planning for the balance of fiscal 2018 indicates that a portion of our first quarter shortfall will be recovered over the remainder of the fiscal year, bringing annual production and costs in line with our guidance.\\\"\\nStrategy and Outlook\\nThe Company continues to pursue its objectives of optimizing production, lowering unitary cash costs, maximizing fee cash flow, extending the life-of-mine of its operations and growing its operations to deliver shareholder value.\\nEl Valle\\nAt El Valle, the primary objective in fiscal 2018 continues to be replacing mined skarn tonnes with higher gold grade oxides in order to bring the proportion of oxide ore processed in the plant up to a target of 50%, thereby substantially increasing ore grades delivered to the mill and increasing gold ounce production. Through additional geological and geotechnical work, the Company also expects to significantly increase the reliability of the mine plan by minimizing the proportion of inferred material in its mine planning and taking additional measures to address grade variability. Infrastructure and fleet maintenance investments to improve productivity and efficiency will continue to be made through fiscal 2018 as planned. It is anticipated that these actions will also positively impact El Valle's unitary costs in fiscal 2018.\\nDon Mario\\nAt Don Mario, the Company continues to produce consistent results from its re-commissioned CIL circuit, producing an average of over 12,000 ounces of gold per quarter from the Lower Mineralized Zone. Don Mario continues to pursue realization of a number of known opportunities for mine life extension. In the near term, the Company expects to commence pre-stripping activities at Cerro Felix in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and intends to transition its mine production to this satellite deposit following the depletion of the LMZ, expected in mid-fiscal 2018. The Company has also been evaluating opportunities to further extend the life of Don Mario, including processing existing mineral stockpiles, potential mining of the Company's Las Tojas deposit, potential mining of the UMZ bottom pit and reprocessing gold bearing tailings.\\nWhile maintaining its focus on optimizing current operations, the Company will also evaluate strategic alternatives that could serve to transform the profile of the Company.\\nFY 2018 Production and Cost Guidance\\nQ1 2018\\nActual\\nFY 2018\\nGuidance\\nEl Valle Production\\nGold (oz)\\n10,784\\n65,000 \\u2013 72,000\\nCopper (million lbs)\\n0.9\\n4.1 \\u2013 4.5\\nDon Mario Production\\nGold (oz)\\n12,388\\n45,000 \\u2013 48,000\\nCopper (million lbs)\\n1.9\\n2.0 \\u2013 2.3\\nTotal Production\\nGold (oz)\\n23,172\\n110,000 \\u2013 120,000\\nCopper (million lbs)\\n2.8\\n6.1 \\u2013 6.8\\nTotal capital expenditures\\n$6,207\\n$24,000 \\u2013 $27,000\\nCash operating costs (by-product) ($/oz) gold (1)\\n$999\\n$950 \\u2013 $1,050\\nAll-in sustaining costs (by-product) ($/oz) gold (1)\\n$1,253\\n$1,150 \\u2013 $1,250\\n(1)\\nFY 2018 guidance assumptions for COC and AISC include by-product commodity prices of $2.75 per pound of copper and an average Euro to US Dollar exchange of 1.20.\\nSelected Operational and Financial Information\\nQ1 2018\\nQ4 2017\\nQ1 2017\\nFY 2017\\nOperating Performance\\nGold\\nProduction (oz)\\n23,172\\n27,666\\n15,699\\n90,292\\nSales (oz)\\n21,995\\n29,639\\n14,060\\n88,636\\nAverage realized price / oz\\n$1,269\\n$1,268\\n$1,260\\n$1,258\\nCopper\\nProduction ('000 lbs)\\n2,759\\n3,601\\n3,588\\n13,893\\nSales ('000 lbs)\\n2,700\\n3,850\\n3,598\\n14,686\\nAverage realized price / lb\\n$2.82\\n$2.74\\n$2.32\\n$2.50\\nFinancial Performance (in 000's, except per share amounts)\\nRevenue\\n$34,170\\n$46,156\\n$23,458\\n$137,999\\nMining costs\\n$28,060\\n$34,562\\n$24,356\\n$116,370\\nGross margin\\n$458\\n$3,274\\n($6,853)\\n($5,480)\\nNet loss\\n($3,379)\\n($1,722)\\n($8,154)\\n($15,555)\\nNet loss per share (basic/diluted)\\n($0.02)\\n($0.01)\\n($0.06)\\n($0.11)\\nEBITDA (1)\\n$4,182\\n$10,313\\n($3,334)\\n$16,535\\nOperating cash flows\\n$2,147\\n$12,328\\n($299)\\n$20,726\\nEnding cash and cash equivalents\\n$20,617\\n$23,811\\n$9,521\\n$23,811\\nCapital expenditures (2)\\n$6,207\\n$5,818\\n$7,719\\n$21,332\\nCash operating costs (by-product) ($/oz) gold (1)\\n$999\\n$902\\n$1,258\\n$1,015\\nAll-in sustaining costs (by-product) ($/oz) gold (1)(2)\\n$1,253\\n$1,145\\n$1,732\\n$1,269\\n(1)\\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\\\"EBITDA\\\"), cash operating costs and all-in sustaining costs are non-IFRS performance measures.\\n(2)\\nEach reported period excludes capital expenditures incurred in the period which will be paid in subsequent periods and includes capital expenditures incurred in prior periods and paid for in the applicable reporting period.

The consolidated gross margin in 4Q17 was 17.2%. Net income attributable to stockholders of the parent was NT$1.77 billion, with earnings per ordinary share of NT$0.15.\\nJason Wang, co-president of UMC, said, \\u201c In the fourth quarter of 2017, UMC\\u2019s foundry revenue was NT$36.54 billion. During the quarter, our capacity utilization from legacy 8\\u201d and 12\\u201d technologies continued to reflect robust demand, despite a decrease in 28nm HKMG contribution. The utilization rate of 90% led to overall wafer shipments of 1.67 million 8-inch equivalents. For the full year of 2017, UMC posted a 7% YoY revenue increase in US dollars as wafer shipments increased nearly 11% annually. As a result, our 2017 net income of the parent company grew nearly 16% year on year, despite experiencing unfavorable movement of the NT dollar in the foreign exchange markets.\\u201d\\nCo-president Wang continued, \\u201cLooking into the first quarter of 2018, we anticipate our foundry business to remain relatively flat. We are continuing our efforts to capture new 28nm business by working to secure new design opportunities, which will help rebuild our 28nm momentum as these new product tape outs are expected to enter production in the following months. In addition, we will leverage our manufacturing excellence to invest in areas with better ROI potential, including 12\\u201d mature technologies as well as tool and equipment upgrades at 8\\u201d facilities. As such, our 2018 CAPEX budget will be approximately US$1.1 billion. I believe our approach to optimizing the offerings across 8\\u201d and 12\\u201d mature technologies while moderating the pace of leading edge expansion will lead to sound financial performance that will preserve the best interests of our shareholders and employees.\\u201d\\nSummary of Operating Results\\nOperating Results (Amount: NT$ million) 4Q17 3Q17 QoQ %\\nchange 4Q16 YoY %\\nchange Net Operating Revenues 36,631 37,698 (2.8) 38,306 (4.4) Gross Profit 6,298 6,592 (4.5) 8,759 (28.1) Operating Expenses (5,198) (5,404) (3.8) (6,627) (21.6) Net Other Operating Income and Expenses 801 441 81.6 144 456.3 Operating Income (Loss) 1,901 1,629 16.7 2,276 (16.5) Net Non-Operating Income and Expenses (152) 1,236 - (1,210) (87.4) Net Income Attributable to Stockholders of the Parent 1,771 3,473 (49.0) 2,548 (30.5) EPS (NT$ per share) 0.15 0.28 0.21 (US$ per ADS) 0.025 0.047 0.035 Net operating revenues in 4Q17 declined 2.8% to NT$36.63 billion, including NT$36.54 billion from the foundry segment.

(TSX:ORV) (the \\\"Company\\\" or \\\"Orvana\\\") announced today financial and operational results for the first quarter (\\\"Q1 2018\\\"). The Company is also providing financial and operational updates for its El Valle and Carl\\u00e9s Mines (collectively, \\\"El Valle\\\") operations in northern Spain and its Don Mario Mine in Bolivia.\\nThe unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for Q1 2018 and Management's Discussion and Analysis related thereto are available on SEDAR and on the Company's website at www.orvana.com .\\nQ1 2018 Highlights\\nThe Company's strategy to increase production at its El Valle operation targets productivity enhancements to allow for delivery of higher gold ore grades to the mill that are expected to result in higher gold ounces to be produced and reduced unitary costs, while at Don Mario the Company is focusing on nearby gold deposits to extend its mine life. The Company reports the following positive developments in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as follows:\\nEl Valle \\u2013 Ramp up of oxides production continues: The proportion of higher gold grade oxide production delivered to the mill from the El Valle Mine increased to 37%, up from 24% in the second half of fiscal 2017. The Company continues to target a ratio of 50% oxides to skarns delivered to the mill by mid-2018.\\nProduction shortfalls were experienced in the first quarter due to fleet availability and the failure in the mine's ventilation system, as well as an unexpected build-up of in-process gold in the plant circuit. A number of process changes in the mine and plant, in addition to maintenance investments, are expected to allow El Valle to attain its stated production guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year. Don Mario \\u2013 Consistent performance: Don Mario continued to generate consistent results from its carbon-in-leach circuit, producing 12,388 ounces of gold with recovery rates averaging 85.8% in the quarter.\\nPre-stripping activities at the Company's nearby Cerro Felix gold deposit commenced during the first quarter. The Company is aiming to begin production from the Cerro Felix deposit starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\\nJuan Gavidia, Interim CEO stated, \\\"Our Don Mario operation continues to deliver consistently strong results from LMZ ore processed through its carbon-in-leach circuit, and we look forward to maintaining this trend with ore from our nearby Cerro Felix gold deposit shortly. At El Valle, our ramp up of higher gold grade oxide production continues, though on a longer timeframe than initially planned. The challenges that we experienced at El Valle in Q1 are in the process of being resolved. Our updated planning for the balance of fiscal 2018 indicates that a portion of our first quarter shortfall will be recovered over the remainder of the fiscal year, bringing annual production and costs in line with our guidance.\\\"\\nStrategy and Outlook\\nThe Company continues to pursue its objectives of optimizing production, lowering unitary cash costs, maximizing fee cash flow, extending the life-of-mine of its operations and growing its operations to deliver shareholder value.\\nEl Valle\\nAt El Valle, the primary objective in fiscal 2018 continues to be replacing mined skarn tonnes with higher gold grade oxides in order to bring the proportion of oxide ore processed in the plant up to a target of 50%, thereby substantially increasing ore grades delivered to the mill and increasing gold ounce production. Through additional geological and geotechnical work, the Company also expects to significantly increase the reliability of the mine plan by minimizing the proportion of inferred material in its mine planning and taking additional measures to address grade variability. Infrastructure and fleet maintenance investments to improve productivity and efficiency will continue to be made through fiscal 2018 as planned. It is anticipated that these actions will also positively impact El Valle's unitary costs in fiscal 2018.\\nDon Mario\\nAt Don Mario, the Company continues to produce consistent results from its re-commissioned CIL circuit, producing an average of over 12,000 ounces of gold per quarter from the Lower Mineralized Zone. Don Mario continues to pursue realization of a number of known opportunities for mine life extension. In the near term, the Company expects to commence pre-stripping activities at Cerro Felix in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and intends to transition its mine production to this satellite deposit following the depletion of the LMZ, expected in mid-fiscal 2018. The Company has also been evaluating opportunities to further extend the life of Don Mario, including processing existing mineral stockpiles, potential mining of the Company's Las Tojas deposit, potential mining of the UMZ bottom pit and reprocessing gold bearing tailings.\\nWhile maintaining its focus on optimizing current operations, the Company will also evaluate strategic alternatives that could serve to transform the profile of the Company.\\nFY 2018 Production and Cost Guidance\\nQ1 2018\\nActual\\nFY 2018\\nGuidance\\nEl Valle Production\\nGold (oz)\\n10,784\\n65,000 \\u2013 72,000\\nCopper (million lbs)\\n0.9\\n4.1 \\u2013 4.5\\nDon Mario Production\\nGold (oz)\\n12,388\\n45,000 \\u2013 48,000\\nCopper (million lbs)\\n1.9\\n2.0 \\u2013 2.3\\nTotal Production\\nGold (oz)\\n23,172\\n110,000 \\u2013 120,000\\nCopper (million lbs)\\n2.8\\n6.1 \\u2013 6.8\\nTotal capital expenditures\\n$6,207\\n$24,000 \\u2013 $27,000\\nCash operating costs (by-product) ($/oz) gold (1)\\n$999\\n$950 \\u2013 $1,050\\nAll-in sustaining costs (by-product) ($/oz) gold (1)\\n$1,253\\n$1,150 \\u2013 $1,250\\n(1)\\nFY 2018 guidance assumptions for COC and AISC include by-product commodity prices of $2.75 per pound of copper and an average Euro to US Dollar exchange of 1.20.\\nSelected Operational and Financial Information\\nQ1 2018\\nQ4 2017\\nQ1 2017\\nFY 2017\\nOperating Performance\\nGold\\nProduction (oz)\\n23,172\\n27,666\\n15,699\\n90,292\\nSales (oz)\\n21,995\\n29,639\\n14,060\\n88,636\\nAverage realized price / oz\\n$1,269\\n$1,268\\n$1,260\\n$1,258\\nCopper\\nProduction ('000 lbs)\\n2,759\\n3,601\\n3,588\\n13,893\\nSales ('000 lbs)\\n2,700\\n3,850\\n3,598\\n14,686\\nAverage realized price / lb\\n$2.82\\n$2.74\\n$2.32\\n$2.50\\nFinancial Performance (in 000's, except per share amounts)\\nRevenue\\n$34,170\\n$46,156\\n$23,458\\n$137,999\\nMining costs\\n$28,060\\n$34,562\\n$24,356\\n$116,370\\nGross margin\\n$458\\n$3,274\\n($6,853)\\n($5,480)\\nNet loss\\n($3,379)\\n($1,722)\\n($8,154)\\n($15,555)\\nNet loss per share (basic/diluted)\\n($0.02)\\n($0.01)\\n($0.06)\\n($0.11)\\nEBITDA (1)\\n$4,182\\n$10,313\\n($3,334)\\n$16,535\\nOperating cash flows\\n$2,147\\n$12,328\\n($299)\\n$20,726\\nEnding cash and cash equivalents\\n$20,617\\n$23,811\\n$9,521\\n$23,811\\nCapital expenditures (2)\\n$6,207\\n$5,818\\n$7,719\\n$21,332\\nCash operating costs (by-product) ($/oz) gold (1)\\n$999\\n$902\\n$1,258\\n$1,015\\nAll-in sustaining costs (by-product) ($/oz) gold (1)(2)\\n$1,253\\n$1,145\\n$1,732\\n$1,269\\n(1)\\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\\\"EBITDA\\\"), cash operating costs and all-in sustaining costs are non-IFRS performance measures.\\n(2)\\nEach reported period excludes capital expenditures incurred in the period which will be paid in subsequent periods and includes capital expenditures incurred in prior periods and paid for in the applicable reporting period.

The consolidated gross margin in 4Q17 was 17.2%. Net income attributable to stockholders of the parent was NT$1.77 billion, with earnings per ordinary share of NT$0.15.\\nJason Wang, co-president of UMC, said, \\u201c In the fourth quarter of 2017, UMC\\u2019s foundry revenue was NT$36.54 billion. During the quarter, our capacity utilization from legacy 8\\u201d and 12\\u201d technologies continued to reflect robust demand, despite a decrease in 28nm HKMG contribution. The utilization rate of 90% led to overall wafer shipments of 1.67 million 8-inch equivalents. For the full year of 2017, UMC posted a 7% YoY revenue increase in US dollars as wafer shipments increased nearly 11% annually. As a result, our 2017 net income of the parent company grew nearly 16% year on year, despite experiencing unfavorable movement of the NT dollar in the foreign exchange markets.\\u201d\\nCo-president Wang continued, \\u201cLooking into the first quarter of 2018, we anticipate our foundry business to remain relatively flat. We are continuing our efforts to capture new 28nm business by working to secure new design opportunities, which will help rebuild our 28nm momentum as these new product tape outs are expected to enter production in the following months. In addition, we will leverage our manufacturing excellence to invest in areas with better ROI potential, including 12\\u201d mature technologies as well as tool and equipment upgrades at 8\\u201d facilities. As such, our 2018 CAPEX budget will be approximately US$1.1 billion. I believe our approach to optimizing the offerings across 8\\u201d and 12\\u201d mature technologies while moderating the pace of leading edge expansion will lead to sound financial performance that will preserve the best interests of our shareholders and employees.\\u201d\\nSummary of Operating Results\\nOperating Results (Amount: NT$ million) 4Q17 3Q17 QoQ %\\nchange 4Q16 YoY %\\nchange Net Operating Revenues 36,631 37,698 (2.8) 38,306 (4.4) Gross Profit 6,298 6,592 (4.5) 8,759 (28.1) Operating Expenses (5,198) (5,404) (3.8) (6,627) (21.6) Net Other Operating Income and Expenses 801 441 81.6 144 456.3 Operating Income (Loss) 1,901 1,629 16.7 2,276 (16.5) Net Non-Operating Income and Expenses (152) 1,236 - (1,210) (87.4) Net Income Attributable to Stockholders of the Parent 1,771 3,473 (49.0) 2,548 (30.5) EPS (NT$ per share) 0.15 0.28 0.21 (US$ per ADS) 0.025 0.047 0.035 Net operating revenues in 4Q17 declined 2.8% to NT$36.63 billion, including NT$36.54 billion from the foundry segment.
